# Quilting Web App --- W.I.P. ---

This web application was developed as a project for a local quilter who wanted some sort of digital way to interact with their quilting projects. As of now, it is just a simple project management space where you can perform basic CRUD operations on a database of your quilting projects. For now, I've tailored it specifically to the art of quilting. In the future, I may refactor it to be a blank slate for managing any sort of creative hobby.

## Notes

I've decided to use a third-party ServeMux, [httprouter](https://godoc.org/github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter) instead of Go's standard net/http DefaultServeMux as I find the syntax cleaner and appropriate for my needs with this project. 

## Set-Up

You will need to configure a PostgreSQL databsae (or I suppose any SQL relational database would work fine) with the following fields:
- Qid (an autoincrementing (serial primary key) number)
- Name 
- Style
- Pattern 

Then, you will need to create a proper login string for your PostgreSQL database and import it into the config/db.go file as an environment variable.
