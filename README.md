# Quilting Web App Documentation

This web application was developed as a project for a local quilter who wanted some sort of digital way to interact with their quilting projects. As of now, it is just a simple project management space where you can perform basic CRUD operations on a database of your quilting projects. For now, I've tailored it specifically to the art of quilting. In the future, I may refactor it to be a blank slate for managing any sort of creative hobby.
